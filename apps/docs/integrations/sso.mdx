# What is SSO?

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows your users to log in to Feedbackthing using their existing account from your application. This means that your users don't have to create a new account for Feedbackthing before they can leave feedback.

# How does it work?

Here's a quick overview of how the SSO flow works:

1. Your user clicks on the **Login with `{Your App}`** button on your Feedbackthing hub.

2. Feedbackthing redirects your user to your application's configured SSO login page. We'll send along a `redirect_to` parameter in the query string so that you can redirect your user back to Feedbackthing after they've logged in. E.g. `https://yourapp.com/sso/Feedbackthing?redirect_to=https://{slug}.feedbackthing.pro/feedback`.

3. Your application authenticates the user and creates a custom JWT token.

4. Your application redirects the user back to Feedbackthing with the custom JWT token and the `redirect_to` parameter. E.g. `https://{slug}.feedbackthing.pro/api/v1/{slug}/sso?jwt={JWT}&redirect_to=https://Feedbackthing.io/hub/your-hub-id`.

5. Feedbackthing verifies the JWT token, authenticates the user, and redirects them to the `redirect_to` parameter.

# Configuring SSO

## Create a dedicated SSO login page

The first step is to create a dedicated SSO login page in your application. This page will be used to authenticate your users and create a custom JWT token. 

You can use any url for this page, but we recommend using a url like `https://yourapp.com/sso/Feedbackthing` so that it's clear that this page is used for Feedbackthing SSO authentication.

## Enable the SSO Integration in Feedbackthing

Once you've created your SSO login page, you can enable the SSO integration in Feedbackthing. You can do this in your [Integration Settings](https://Feedbackthing.io/hub/{slug}/settings/integrations) by clicking on the **Connect** button for the **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration.

This will open a modal which will ask you to enter the URL of your SSO login page. Enter the URL and copy the **JWT Secret** that Feedbackthing generates for you. You'll need to use this secret to sign the JWT tokens that you generate in your SSO login page.

Finally, click on the **Enable** button to enable the SSO integration.

## Authenticate your users and create a JWT token

When users get redirected to your SSO login page, you'll need to authenticate them with your existing authentication system.

Once you've authenticated your users, you'll need to create a JWT token and redirect them back to Feedbackthing with the token and the `redirect_to` parameter.

Here's an example of how you can do this in Node.js:

```js
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

function createJwtToken(user) {
  const payload = {
    name: user.name,
    email: user.email,
    avatar_url: user.avatar_url, // Optional
  };

  // Do not expose your secret in your client side code!
  return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.Feedbackthing_JWT_SECRET);
}
```

## Redirect your users back to Feedbackthing

Once you've created the JWT token, you'll need to redirect your users back to Feedbackthing with the token and the `redirect_to` parameter.

Here's an example of the redirect URL that you'll need to use:

<Note>If you are using a custom domain for your project, you'll need to replace `{slug}.feedbackthing.pro` with your custom domain.</Note>

```
https://{slug}.feedbackthing.pro/api/v1/{slug}/sso?jwt={JWT}&redirect_to={Redirect URL}
```

You'll need to replace the following placeholders:

- `{slug}`: The slug of your project.
- `{JWT}`: The JWT token that you created in the previous step.
- `{Redirect URL}`: The URL that you want to redirect your users to after they've been authenticated.
